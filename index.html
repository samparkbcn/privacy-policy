    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sam AI Assistant</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: April 10, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>At <strong>Sam AI Assistant</strong>, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you interact with our WhatsApp chatbot:</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following data when you interact with our chatbot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone Numbers:</strong> When you send a message to the bot, we collect your phone number in order to send responses back to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Message Data:</strong> We collect the content of the messages you send to provide you with responses from the chatbot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data only for the purpose of providing responses to your messages through the chatbot. We do not use your data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not retain any data after the conversation ends. All personal data, including phone numbers and messages, is <strong>not stored</strong> and is deleted immediately after the session ends. We do not keep any information on our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Data</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal data or messages with any third parties, except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, we do not store or process it, so there is no data to protect once the conversation ends.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store or retain your data, there is no data to request access to, correction, or deletion for.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our chatbot uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT technology to process and respond to your messages. OpenAI may collect data as outlined in their privacy policy, which you can review <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be updated.</p>
